Milestone Outputs
Note: Please note that some modifications have been done to the duration and funding percentages due to the timeline of the onboarding process and limitation of milestone numbers in the module. When it says ""May"", ""June"" etc. we generally mean the first day of the month and closer to it.
This milestone will lay the groundwork for a successful project roadmap involving stakeholders (like Catalyst team, community and Ada holders, dRep community or SPOs etc.). Discussion of stack choices, challenges and team roles.

 Feedback from stakeholders and discussion of Catalyst Voices and Voltaire Roadmap integration

Inventory of known Catalyst projects and community contributions during previous funds we are aware of and interested parties can publicly contribute to.
List of collaborators, volunteers and team members
Documentation that shares deliverables of “Data-Driven Catalyst” project with the broader community, to increase access beyond the Milestones Module, giving more discussion-style scope and allow feedback and iteration from feedback. This could be a Medium article and downloadable PDF linked from our Gitbook or similar format.
Use cases, background and scope published on Gitbook
Discussion of recent AI “hype” and its possible impact on Catalyst (risks and opportunities)

Third submission of M1 POA. What is new in this submission:
Additional Google Drive link (Chats.pdf) with evidence of private chats and public Telegram channel posts
If this evidence is not sufficient please let us know in Discussion module or reach out on Telegram @tomwedler
Workshop with full video recording will be provided as part of Milestone-2, M1 is just setting the stage and did not have video recording of meetings as required evidence.
Thanks!
Work on the project is on-going and publicly accessible and constant changes and improvements will happen to the repo.
Please find below Evidence as listed in the SOM for M1.
To give a better overview and due to the large amount of different, preliminary building blocks that lay the foundation for later milestones, we have recorded a video walk-through for the First Milestone in addition to other relevant publicly accessible documentation links below.

Shared our Twitter handle on Github public repository, during Townhall and welcoming messages
More social media activity and larger workshop to occur as part of M2 as per SOM.
Gitbook presentation will become more meaningful close to Final Milestone release and community presentation, as the feedback and collaboration of the running project benefits greatly from being on Github to track contributions, contain interactive code, share data sets etc.
