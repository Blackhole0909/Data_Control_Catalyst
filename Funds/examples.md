# 20 examples of Data-Driven Reports using Funds 7 to 10

Rationale: we want to showcase potential for useful community reporting based initially on 3 datasets. At later milestones, more data sources can be added, as "everything is data". This could include social media, Github, LinkedIn, the Milestone module, community-driven or catalyst-funded explorers, databases and APIs like Lido Nation, Wolfram, Cardano Cube and so on.

Based on these examples, much more in-depth analysis will be carried out for 7 directions provided by the community or stakeholders that have exceptional potential to improve decision making or help voters, proposers and governance functions in steering the Catalyst process towards better funding outcomes.

Deliberately leaving out F-11 and F-12 allows us to improve significantly on the in-depth analysis and preserve unused data to test assumptions and conclusions out of sample while maintaining a large enough dataset that includes mixed USD and ADA funding amounts.


## The Datasets

### Voting Results Dataset
We collected, cleaned and simplified public voting results data into a single voting results dataset.

### Community Reviewer Dataset
Based on the casestudy Community Reviewer files, this large dataset comprises all proposal assessments for scoring in the voting app.

### The Lido Nation Dataset
This dataset is built from downloads of the publicly accessible Lido Nation Explorer.


## The Reports

### 1. Keyword Occurrences vs Funding Ratio

*This plot shows the success ratio of proposals containing a certain keyword, versus the benchmark funding ratio of 18.7% and plots the number of occurrences as well*

Proposals with *Africa* in the title performed a lot better than *DeFi* with similar occurrence in the 100 proposals ballpark. This shows the perception of Cardano strength on the continent and its importance for strategic differentiation compared to perceived weakness or undesirability of decentralized financial markets. Adding more similar keywords to the study, looking at more funds could improve this analysis further.

Useful for: voters (bias, funding direction, ecosystem growth), proposers (boosting chances), governance (understanding voting power)

### 2. Funding Request by Fund and Status

*This plot shows in green proposals that were funded from Fund7 through Fund10 and red those that were not funded plotted along a log scale of funding requested*

### 3. YES votes Required for Funding across Funds

*A similar data visualization with very different focus and on different data: how many YES votes were required from fund to fund to get voted in*
