## Working with Fund Data
This section will demonstrate from simple examples to complex ones how past fund data can be collected, cleaned, aggregated and analyzed using the Open Source Data Science Stack to yield insights. The basis for this is the Pandas Python library used for working with data sets that combines elements of Excel spreadsheet, the R language and SQL to offer an accessible framework that across our typical workload is more convenient or powerful than each of these tools on its own. Most importantly, it runs order of magnitude faster than an Excel worksheet would - which is the current format of presenting and analyzing Catalyst data for most users. Although Excel can be "forced" to perform statistical analysis as shown in John Foreman's excellent book [Data Smart](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Smart-Science-Transform-Information/dp/111866146X), it cannot do so without hogging resources and crashing if the datasets get too large.
