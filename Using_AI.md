## Open-Source LLMs

If you want to train, fine-tune, or run a LLM on your own, there are a number of models available, ranging from older models from major AI companies to non-commercial research models, to some more recent, permissively licensed models.

**[Google BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert)**
One of the first openly available transformer-based LLMs and available under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.
BERT is the foundation for many of the tools for scientific applications of LLMs.

**[OpenAI GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2)**
OpenAI’s 2nd generation LLM, released under a permissive MIT license. GPT-2 is now 4 years old, so well-behind the
state-of-the-art, but ground-breaking at the time.

**[BLOOM](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/bloom)**
A multi-lingual LLM by a large consortium of researchers and organizations, including Hugging Face. It is opensourced under the Responsible AI License (usable commercially with some restrictions, particularly around
disclosure and medical use-cases). There is also BLOOMZ which is fine-tuned for following instructions rather than
conversation.

**9Falcon LLM](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae)**
An LLM released by the Technology Innovation Institute under a permissive Apache 2.0 license. This is used as a
basis for a number of other open tools, such as LAION’s Open Assistant (https://open-assistant.io/).

**9MPT-30B](https://mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-30b)**
A collection of LLMs with different optimizations trained inexpensively on very large input sets. Released by
MosaicML under the Apache 2.0 license with the intent that it is commercially usable.

**[Dolly/Pythia](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dolly-v2-12b)**
An LLM tuned by Databricks based on the Pythia LLM. It is not cutting edge but is large and released under an MIT
license.

**[Stanford University Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html)**
A model based on Meta’s LLaMA v1 produced by the Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) group at
Stanford. The model is open-sourced under a non-commercial license and designed to be trained inexpensively on
smaller data sets. There are a number of other models derived from this, such as Vicuna (lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-
30-vicuna).

**[LeRF](https://lerf.io)**
LeRF combines the ability to reconstruct a 3D scene from a handful of still images using Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) with LLMs, allowing easy searching of a 3D scene using natural language. The models and code are open
source but currently without a license, and so not yet commercially usable.
