**[Discovery](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/409/about)**

In Fund10, the Cardano community gave consent for the Catalyst Team to begin realizing a technical roadmap that advances the state of the art for the innovation funding platform offered by Project Catalyst.

The goal of Catalyst Systems Improvements: Discovery category is to explore new strategic requirements or test technical or procedural experiments for Catalyst which have not yet demonstrated that high degrees of validation has already been achieved.

By following a data-driven approach to design and testing that benefits Project Catalyst, outputs achieved from this category will develop a shared understanding among the Cardano community about which priorities should be developed to service the broader innovation ecosystem building on Cardano.   

**Areas of interest:**

Architectural design research for engineering of decentralization and/or distribution of decision-making advances for the Catalyst Voting System
Research that clearly defines a known Catalyst-specific problem-space where the intention is to identify facts and/or clearly stated opinions that will likely assist in producing novel, Catalyst-specific technical requirements. 
Detailed studies of a Catalyst-specific subject, especially in order to discover (new) information or reach a (new) understanding for the benefit of servicing the broader innovation community building on Cardano.
