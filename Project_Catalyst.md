### What is Project Catalyst exactly and how to make it more Data-Driven
[Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/)

*Section under construction, feedback wanted.*

### Iteration and The Experiment

### Decentralized Governance
This section looks at how community roles past, present and future shape Project Catalyst and how quantitative tools can make their work easier and inform improvements in the process.

### Liquid Democracy and dReps
With the advent of the [Voltaire era](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/) ADA holders will be able to delegate their voting power to Catalyst dReps. This is likely to increase voting participation and proposal scrutiny - can past fund rule changes predict those changes?

### Community Reviewer and Proposal Scores
Review scores' influence of voting outcomes has changed dramatically across past funds - can we visualize and explain this?

### Funding and Voting
Relationships between funding requested, funding available and voter response are important to understand decentralized allocation of Treasury capital.

### Performance and Milestones
AI and quantitative analysis of the milestones module could greatly facilitate measuring KPIs like reviewer response times, check for duplicate or plagiarized evidence or search for proposals that contribute to open source collaboration or essential libraries.

### Abuse and Policing
Level 2 [Reviewers](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/current-fund-basics/community-review-guidelines-fund12/community-reviewer-levels) currently use common sense and their experience to filter out profanity, use of AI and substandard reviews - but could AI or data science help them do a better job?

How do we use data to spot irregularity in proposal submission, review and voting?

As believers in "code as law" can we hard code fund rules and simulate or test automatic enforcement?

TODO: Formats, database and stack evolution, fund history and evolution, notes on 

**[Discovery](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/409/about)**

*In Fund10, the Cardano community gave consent for the Catalyst Team to begin realizing a technical roadmap that advances the state of the art for the innovation funding platform offered by Project Catalyst.*

*The goal of Catalyst Systems Improvements: Discovery category is to explore new strategic requirements or test technical or procedural experiments for Catalyst which have not yet demonstrated that high degrees of validation has already been achieved.*

*By following a data-driven approach to design and testing that benefits Project Catalyst, outputs achieved from this category will develop a shared understanding among the Cardano community about which priorities should be developed to service the broader innovation ecosystem building on Cardano.*   

**Areas of interest:**

*Architectural design research for engineering of decentralization and/or distribution of decision-making advances for the Catalyst Voting System
Research that clearly defines a known Catalyst-specific problem-space where the intention is to identify facts and/or clearly stated opinions that will likely assist in producing novel, Catalyst-specific technical requirements.*
*Detailed studies of a Catalyst-specific subject, especially in order to discover (new) information or reach a (new) understanding for the benefit of servicing the broader innovation community building on Cardano.*
