# Data-Driven_Catalyst
Research and showcase optimal technology stack and procedures to build publicly accessible database and data mining toolkit. Learn more between funds as an ecosystem by pouring through all the available data and finding out what works and what doesn't.

## Structure
This binder has five distinct sections: 
(1) the **Roadmap** of this project - its parts and planned delivery dates
(2) overview of the Open Source Data Science (**OSDS**) ecosystem and stack and how this can bring cutting edge machine learning, data visualization and artificial intelligence applications to everyone thanks to permissive licenses and easy, low-code modules.
(3) overview of how **Project Catalyst** generates data and can be understood and improved with data science, and how this has changed over the funds and is likely or desirable to evolve in the future.
(4) **Working with fund data** takes the theoretical and introductory outline of Catalyst data to concrete applications and examples and works through demonstrations that are either particularly elegant or of didactic value, or have been requested by the community and stakeholders as part of this project.
(5) **Using AI** expands the data science definition to more recent, more sophisticated applications like Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI to showcase how human community reviewers, supervisors and voters can benefit from AI augmentation, conversational data discovery or unsupervised prompts. This includes a discussion of limitations and risks of AI as well.
On the Github repository there are a further three folders for **Code**, **Funds** data and **Workshop** footage and minutes.
